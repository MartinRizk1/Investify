# Investify Frontend

This is the React-based frontend for the Investify application, providing a clean, modern UI for stock analysis and visualization.

## Features

- Real-time stock price updates via WebSocket
- Technical indicator visualization (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- AI-powered stock predictions and analysis
- Clean, responsive UI for all device sizes
- Dark theme by default

## Architecture

The frontend is built with React and organized as follows:

- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
  - `/StockChart` - Main price chart component
  - `/TechnicalIndicators` - Technical analysis charts
  - `/StockInfo` - Stock data and statistics display
  - `/SearchBar` - Search interface for stock symbols
  
- `/src/services` - Service modules for data handling
  - `stockService.js` - WebSocket and API integration

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with hot reloading.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

API requests will be automatically proxied to the Go backend running on port 8083.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
